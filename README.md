## Introduction

Artificial neural networks emulate the functionality of biological neural systems. By incorporating the principles of first passage processes, this project bridges statistical physics and neural network modeling. First passage processes, a specialized stochastic framework, allow for the analysis of neuron activation dynamics by evaluating how potential thresholds are crossed within a network. This novel approach provides enhanced computational frameworks and deeper insights into activation cascades.

## First Passage Processes

### Overview

First passage processes analyze the probabilities and time scales for a stochastic system to reach a specific threshold. These processes form the backbone of various disciplines by enabling precise modeling of critical transitions in dynamic systems.

### Applications in Diverse Disciplines

- **Neuroscience**: Analyzing neural firing thresholds and signal transmission.
- **Physics**: Studying critical threshold dynamics in particle systems.
- **Finance**: Predicting critical stock price movements and enhancing trading algorithms.

### Key Metrics: First Passage and Occupation Probability

- **First Passage Probability (F(r, t))**: Measures the likelihood that a system reaches a defined state for the first time at a given moment.
-  **Occupation Probability (P(r, t))**: Represents the likelihood of the system being in a specific state at any given time.

These metrics are critical for understanding dynamic behaviors and activation patterns.

## First Passage Process Analogy in Neural Networks

### Threshold Dynamics in ANNs

Neurons in an ANN transmit signals when their potential crosses a predefined threshold. This firing behavior can be analyzed using FP processes to calculate the typical time for threshold crossings, triggering activation cascades throughout the network.

### Synaptic Interaction Simulations

Synaptic ends in the network, comprising receptors and transmitters, can be modeled using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The process includes:
- **Initialization**: Randomizing receptor and transmitter states.
- **Simulation**: Applying MD techniques to explore interactions and threshold dynamics.
- **Analysis**: Investigating the resulting neural activation patterns and computational efficiency.
